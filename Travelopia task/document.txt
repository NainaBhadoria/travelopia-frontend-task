Overview of the task:

1. I have designed a full-page, full-width, full-height component, which works on all screen sizes. 

2. The header is fully responsive and consists of menu items with dummy links. I have added the transition effects on hover 
of these menu items. In mobile the hamburger icon has been added. When we click on the hamburger icon the sliding menu will be displayed 
along with some transition effect.

3. After the header, image (width-1920px height-1080px) has been inserted through html code which covers all the white spaces. The image is
fully responsive. Different image has been used for different screen sizes (IPad and mobile) to optimize the page to get better performance.

4. A translucent overlay has been inserted above the image. A title and a button which says Click here has been displayed in the center of
the page. I have given the transition effect to the button also. 

5. When we click on the button an alert is being displayed which reads Hello World!.

6. At last we can see the footer of the page. 


Note for the Code:

I have tried my best to use the minimal HTML, CSS and Javascript code to shorten the DOM size and also for optimization purpose for better 
performance of the page. 

Thankyou.
